Convert term.c to term.w (for testing, build "weston" from source - see below).
After that, read term.ps and understand how to integrate necessary stuff from libtoytoolkit.a
directly to term.w (this library is what building "weston" from source is necessary for).

HOW TO BUILD:

cd /usr/local/src/
apt-get source weston
cd weston-*
apt-get build-dep weston
dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -b -rfakeroot
