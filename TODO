convert term.c to term.w (for testing build weston from debian package - see below)
after that, read term.ps and understand how to get rid of stuff which is in libtoytoolkit.a

HOW TO BUILD:

cd /usr/local/src/
apt-get source weston
cd weston-*
apt-get build-dep weston
dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -b -rfakeroot
