Examples of using quire.tex

If \shthickness=non-zero is used, margin size changes when number of pages changes, which
means text may fall-off from printable area.
Therefore, we keep margin size fixed, but this makes \hsize depend on number of pages,
which influences line and page breaking throughout a document.
From this it follows that
it is safe to use \shthickness=non-zero when changing \hsize a little does not influence
number of pages, like in стихи.tex
If it is not safe, use \shthickness=non-zero only when a document is finished,
and then comment line 238 in quire.tex temporarily and see number of pages NUM which running
of tex produces and add this after setting \hsize:
    \dimen0=\shthickness \multiply\dimen0 by 1/4NUM
    \horigin=\htotal \advance\horigin by-\hsize \advance\horigin by-\dimen0
    \divide\horigin by2 \advance\horigin by\dimen0
BUT then \hsize needs to be re-calculated, BUT then \horigin
needs to be re-calculated, BUT then \hsize needs to be re-calculated, etc.
I do not know how to deal with this, so use only safe method, or do not use staples (see below)

\shthickness=0pt is used if we do not use staples (see иллюзии.tex)

In any case, use \shthickness=0pt and \quire{4} until document is completed

NOTE: seems considerations about \shthickness=non-zero above are not quite correct - see TODO in стихи.tex
