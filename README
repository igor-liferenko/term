Add this after setting \hsize in each document using QUIRE.tex:
    {\catcode`_=11
      \count255=\q_goal \divide\count255 by2 \advance\count255 by-1
      \dimen0=\shthickness \multiply\dimen0 by\count255
      \global\advance\hsize by-\dimen0}
Use \shthickness=0pt and \quire{4} until document is completed.
After document is completed, use \shthickness=.27mm
After connecting the pages with thread and needle, cut protruding parts of pages.
